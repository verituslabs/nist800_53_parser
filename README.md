# nist800_53_parser

This is an open source project to write a simple parser for the NIST 800.53 standard (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final).

The object is to use existing XML parsing libraries to ingest the XML version of the standard and then provide a simple API to transform the standard.
